Problem Statement

Airline companies aim to understand what factors influence passenger satisfaction. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied based on service quality and travel experience data.

Dataset

The dataset contains passenger demographics, travel type, service ratings, and satisfaction labels.

Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and scaling

Train-test split

Model training and comparison

Hyperparameter tuning

Model evaluation and prediction

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve model performance.

Results

The optimized models achieved over 97% accuracy, with Random Forest and SVC performing the best.

Key Insights

Seat comfort, inflight service, and online boarding strongly influence satisfaction.

Business class passengers show higher satisfaction levels.

Hyperparameter tuning helped reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting airline passenger satisfaction and extracting business-oriented insights to improve customer experience.

Future Scope

The model can be integrated into a web application using Streamlit or Flask for real-time prediction.

Note

The trained model file is not uploaded due to GitHub file size limitations. It can be generated by running the training notebook.
